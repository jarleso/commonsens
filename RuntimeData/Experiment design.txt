Uses environment e1.env.

Single state statements:

( ( DetectPerson == Person1 null -1 -1 min 0 ) , -1 -1 min 0 ) (c1.stm) : When the condition is satisfied the state machine should go into the final state. All the sensors that provide the capability in the environment should report a positive reading in order for the state to be satisfied. 

Tests: 
c1_e1_LoI3.mov e1.env = no trigger
c1_e2_all.mov e2.env = fulfulled
